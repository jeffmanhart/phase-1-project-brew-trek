# Brew Trek

Brew Trek is an application to allow users to discover breweries by city, zip code, or all.  Breweries will be displayed and give users the ability to build a brewery trek that makes sense to them or within walking distance of eachother.  From the list you build users can save that list of breweries for future use or other users to follow.  These will allow for ratings and the ability to find them again.

## Installation

Use the Json Server to be able to save and retrieve treks from the local db.  
First install the server globally.  
Then start the server and let it run.
```bash
npm install -g json-server
json-server --watch db.json
```

## Usage

```javascript
code examples
```
## Future Improvements
- build a mapping capability to show the route to walk from one location to the next
- provide a time calculation to alot for each location based on total time desired input
