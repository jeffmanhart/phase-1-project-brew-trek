# Brew Trek

Brew Trek is an application to allow users to discover breweries by city, zip code, or all.  Breweries will be displayed and give users the ability to build a brewery tour that makes sense to them or within walking distance of eachother.  From the list you build users can save that list of breweries for future use or other users to follow.  These will allow for ratings and the ability to find them again.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
npm i
```

## Usage

```javascript

## Future Improvements
- build a mapping capability to show the route to walk from one location to the next
- provide a time calculation to alot for each location based on total time desired input
